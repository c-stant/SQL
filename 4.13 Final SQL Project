Final SQL Project for the Break Into Tech Course

I worked with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.


-- 1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

select *
from chinook_db
;

select *
from customers
;

select customers.FirstName
, customers.LastName
, customers.CustomerId
, customers.Country
from customers
where customers.country <> "USA"
;

-- 2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

select customers.FirstName
, customers.LastName
, customers.CustomerId
, customers.Country
from customers
where customers.country = "Brazil"
;

-- 3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

select *
from invoices
;

select customers.FirstName
, customers.LastName
, customers.CustomerId
, invoices.InvoiceId
, invoices.InvoiceDate
, invoices.BillingCountry
from customers
inner join invoices
on customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
where invoices.billingcountry = "Brazil"
;

-- 4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

select *
from employees
where title = "Sales Support Agent"
;

-- 5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

select distinct billingcountry
from invoices ASC
;

-- 6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

select employees.firstname
, employees.lastname
, employees.title
, employees.employeeid
from employees
where title = "Sales Support Agent"
;

select *
from invoices
;

select customers.SupportRepId
from customers
;

select employees.firstname
, employees.lastname
, invoices.InvoiceId
from employees
inner join customers
on employees.EmployeeId = customers.SupportRepId
inner join invoices
on customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
where title = "Sales Support Agent"
order by invoiceid ASC
;

-- 7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

select invoices.total
, customers.FirstName
, customers.LastName
, employees.FirstName
, employees.LastName
from invoices
inner join customers
on invoices.CustomerId = customers.customerid
inner join employees
on customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId
where title = "Sales Support Agent"
;

-- 8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

select invoiceid
, invoicedate
from invoices
;

select sum (invoicedate) AS invoices_2009
from invoices
where invoicedate like '2009%'
;

-- 9. What are the total sales for 2009?

select sum (total) AS invoices_2009
from invoices
where invoicedate like '2009%'
;

-- 10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

select distinct invoice_items.InvoiceLineId
, tracks.name
from invoice_items
inner join tracks
on invoice_items.trackid = tracks.TrackId
where tracks.unitprice > 0
;

-- 11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

select distinct invoice_items.InvoiceLineId
, tracks.name
, artists.name
from invoice_items
inner join tracks
on invoice_items.trackid = tracks.TrackId
inner join albums
on tracks.albumid = albums.albumid
inner join artists
on albums.ArtistId = artists.ArtistId
;

-- 12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

select tracks.name AS track_name
, albums.Title AS album_title
, media_types.Name AS media_type
, genres.name AS genre
from tracks
inner join albums
on tracks.AlbumId = albums.albumid
inner join media_types
on tracks.MediaTypeId = media_types.MediaTypeId
left join genres
on tracks.GenreId = genres.GenreId
order by genre ASC
;

-- 13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

select sum (invoices.total)
from invoices
;

select SUM (invoices.Total)
, employees.FirstName
, employees.LastName
from invoices
inner join customers
on invoices.customerid = customers.CustomerId
inner join employees
on customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId
group by employees.firstname
;

-- 14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

select sum (invoices.total)
from invoices
where invoices.InvoiceDate like '%2009%'
;

select SUM (invoices.total)
, invoices.InvoiceDate
, employees.firstname
, employees.lastname
from invoices
inner join customers
on invoices.CustomerId = customers.customerid
inner join employees 
on customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId
where invoicedate like '%2009%'
group by employees.firstname
;
