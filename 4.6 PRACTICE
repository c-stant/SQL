-- 1. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?

SELECT distinct location
, count (orderid)
from bit_db.JanSales
where location like '%New York%'
and orderid <> 'Order ID'
group by location
having count (orderid)>=3
;

-- 2. DOUBLE CHECK How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT sum (quantity) AS QUANTITY
, product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product LIKE '$Headphones%'
GROUP BY product
;

-- 3. What was the average amount spent per account in February?
-- (Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account.
-- To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)

SELECT sum(quantity*price)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS cust
ON FEB.orderid = cust.order_id

WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

-- 4. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
-- (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).

SELECT sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS cust
ON Feb.orderid = cust.order_id

WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

-- 5. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT product
, sum(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY sum(quantity*price) DESC
LIMIT 1
;

            SELECT sum(quantity)
            , price
            , sum(quantity)*price AS rev1
            , sum(quantity*price) AS rev2
            FROM bit_db.JanSales    
            GROUP BY product
            ;
